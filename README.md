# Framework Factory
> Framework Factory is a PHP application starter package. It's inspired by the Laravel framework, without all
> the bells and whistles. At its core is a robust and powerful PSR-11 compatible dependency container. Aside
> from Pest for testing and Pint for formatting it requires no external dependencies and relies strictly on 
> its own built-in, internal libraries.
>
> The aim is to make building a PHP 8 powered application a breeze, by giving a construct for the
> beginning stages of application development. Provided is an application entrypoint interface, and
> the logic needed to get your next project going with minimal boilerplate overhead.
>
> You can see a basic demonstration implementation by visiting the demo repository [here](https://github.com/Framework-Factory/demo).
